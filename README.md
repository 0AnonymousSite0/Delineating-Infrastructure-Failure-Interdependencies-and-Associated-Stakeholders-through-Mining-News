# Data and Codes for Delineating-Infrastructure-Failure-Interdependencies-and-Associated-Stakeholders-through-News-Mining


1. This repository is for store the appendices for the paper named “Delineating Infrastructure Failure Interdependencies and Associated Stakeholders through Mining News articles”

2. The “Specifications of Tables. S1-S5.pdf” has listed the raw data and contents in different Excels.

3. The codes we made are based on developed open python libraries, our uses obey their license, including 
  Numpy (https://numpy.org/), 
  NLTK (https://www.nltk.org/), 
  Jieba (https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba), 
  Scrapy (https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy), 
  OpenCC (https://github.com/yichen0831/opencc-python), 
  pyExcelerator (https://github.com/WoLpH/pyExcelerator),
  and so on.

4. Before re-using the python codes, you should adjust the file paths of demanded materials in the codes according to your operating environment.

5. The five codes provided have been tested before submitting them. They all perform well as the following five figures.
